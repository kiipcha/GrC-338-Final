Hello world! My name is Nicole Libby. Just your average college student trying to better herself year after year. But I've found that when I only focus on my long term goals, I don't make as much progress. I'll tell myself that there is always next year, or that I have all the time in the world. In the end, I end up stuck.
<br><br>
As of 2017, I think I might have found a way around it. Annual bucket list! To keep myself accountable for my long term goals, I need yearly tasks to complete. Come better yourself with me!
